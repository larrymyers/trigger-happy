# Trigger Happy

Trigger Happy is a cross browser javascript library for programmatically triggering events on
DOM elements, simulating user interaction. It was developed specifically with automated testing in mind,
and was inspired by the author's frustrations with using selenium to test client side code.

Currently this library has been tested in:

* IE 8
* IE 9
* Firefox 3.6+
* Chrome 7+
* Safari 5+

## How to Use

In progress, in the meantime the testsuite in test/testpage.html served as reasonable documentation.

## Example

In Progress.
